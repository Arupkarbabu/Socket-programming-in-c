1) Write a Client-Server based socket program in C to transfer a text file from client to the server. The prototypes to run the client and servers are as below.
$./server <IP Address> <Port No>
$./client <Server's IP address> <Server's Port No> <File Name>

If you run both the client and the server on the same computer, use a different folder for client and server so that the file to be transferred from the client will not be over-written by the server.

Deadline: 13th August, 2019 (Demonstration). Prepare the Report (in the form of a Note Book) and get it signed by a TA.

Note: If you finish before due date, you can also demonstrate your assignment to the TAs in a mutually convenient time.
