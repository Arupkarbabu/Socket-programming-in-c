1) Write a Client-Server based socket program in C to transfer a text file from client to the server.
The prototypes to run the client and servers are as below.

$./server <IP Address> <Port No>
$./client <Server's IP address> <Server's Port No> <File Name>

If you run both the client and the server on the same computer, 
use a different folder for client and server so that the file to be
transferred from the client will not be over-written by the server.
